Port forwarding is accomplished with the `-L` switch, which creates a link to a **L**ocal port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:  
`ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`  
We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 _on our own_ _attacking machine._ For example, by entering `localhost:8000` into a web browser. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own box. Note that it's good practice to use a high port, out of the way, for the local connection. This means that the low ports are still open for their correct use (e.g. if we wanted to start our own webserver to serve an exploit to a target), and also means that we do not need to use `sudo` to create the connection. The `-fN` combined switch does two things: `-f` backgrounds the shell immediately so that we have our own terminal back. `-N` tells SSH that it doesn't need to execute any commands -- only set up the connection.
