    Reading news articles about the target company.
Active Recon:
gathering info from active methods
  Social ENgineering

Whois:
the whois protocol is a standard used to gain info about a server

we can learn:

    Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
    Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things. (unless made hidden via a privacy service)
    Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first registered? When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?
    Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?

nslookup and dig:

ns lookup allows us to resolve a domain name
you can also add options

DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own. The domain you are inspecting might include a different subdomain 
that can reveal much information about the target. For instance, if tryhackme.com has the subdomains wiki.tryhackme.com and webmail.tryhackme.com,
you want to learn more about these two as they can hold a trove of information about your target. There is a possibility that one of these subdomains
has been set up and is not updated regularly. Lack of proper regular updates usually leads to vulnerable services.
