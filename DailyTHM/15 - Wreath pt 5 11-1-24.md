 - [x] Task 11: SSH [[Tunneling]] / [[Port Forwarding]]
If you're connecting to an SSH server _from_ your attacking machine to create a port forward, would this be a local (L) port forward or a remote (R) port forward?
	l
Which switch combination can be used to background an SSH port forward or tunnel?
	-fn
It's a good idea to enter our own password on the remote machine to set up a reverse proxy, Aye or Nay?
	Nay
What command would you use to create a pair of throwaway SSH keys for a reverse connection?
	ssh-keygen
If you wanted to set up a reverse portforward from port 22 of a remote machine (172.16.0.100) to port 2222 of your local machine (172.16.0.200), using a keyfile called `id_rsa` and backgrounding the shell, what command would you use? (Assume your username is "kali")
	ssh -r 22:172.16.0.100 kali@172.16.0.200:2222 -i id_rsa -fN
What command would you use to set up a forward proxy on port 8000 to user@target.thm, backgrounding the shell?
	ssh -R  8000 user@target.thm -Fn
If you had SSH access to a server (172.16.0.50) with a webserver running internally on port 80 (i.e. only accessible to the server itself on 127.0.0.1:80), how would you forward it to port 8000 on your attacking machine? Assume the username is "user", and background the shell.
	ssh -r 8000:172.16.0.50 user@127.0.0.1:80

- [x] Task 12: [[Plink]]
what tool can be used to convert OpenSSH keys into PuTTY style keys?
	puttygen
